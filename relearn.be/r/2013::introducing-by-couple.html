He knows OPS from workshops he did there. He participates to the organization of the workshop as one of the official photographer and does a lot more with his friendly contact. </div> <div class="right"> <h3>Stéphanie B by Colmac</h3> Stéphanie studies in the school of Art and Design in Saint-Étienne, France. She is in her fourth year, in a department, which covers design at large. Her interest in F/LOSS came from her involvement in a research group of the school, focusing on Free Culture and Free Software. Her main interests reside in graphic design. </div> </div> <div class="container-couple"> <div class="left"> <h3>Christoph by Peter</h3> Christoph (surname Haag) is from Augsburg, in Bavaria, Germany. His home town is also the home town of Bertolt Brecht, and they still celebrate his life by a festival each year (Brecht’s that is, not Christoph’s — YET; though of course, there will be a fair few in that town who wish to celebrate Christoph’s birthday even now). Christoph studied in Cologne, doing a non-conventional design degree. It was a four-year course, and at the end, from the humble births of a throwaway project to do with demonstrating the electronic transmission of sound waves, he and three others found their first taste of fame. This project, manifested as an interactive installation, was picked up by galleries accross the globe, as far abrest as Sao Paulo, and the Arnolfini art gallery in Bristol, UK. The group travelled the world and no doubt the wisdom held true amongst the young men: “what goes on tour, stays on tour.” (!) Peter was privileged to visit that same exhibition in Bristol in 2010 (where nine months previously he had bumped into Eric, also of OSP and renowned tight pants mega-initiative). Christoph had previously met Simon from our dear workshop, at the Libre Graphics Meeting in Madrid, in 2013. Christoph does not like presenting his ideas but is a fascinating, very knowledgeable and humble person of whom one might say “He really knows what he’s NOT talking about.” (Peter on the other hand wishes to say nearly everything he thinks, including what the Beastie Boys might call “some crazy bulls***t”.)  If you get a chance, speak to Christoph, and you too may wish to hear him one day SING!  </div><div class="right"><h3>Peter by Christoph</h3> He is a librarian from Bristol working at Bath Spa University. Born in Wales with roots in Scotland and living in England, so completely British. Interested in ballet and football and is a very knowledgeable person and nice guy to talk to. </div></div><div class="container-couple"> <div class="left"><h3>Caroline by Ludivine</h3> Caroline is 30 years old and teaches at Erg, which makes at least two things in common with me. She is from Liège but feels like a real Brusseleer. She founded the studio “Kidnap your designer” in 2006 and was joined by Damien about 2 years later. The studio mainly works in the cultural field in Belgium and France. They recently drew the identity of a project called La Panacée in Montpellier. Following Stefan Sagmeister’s philosophy, she considers the end of this seven year period as a good moment to requestion her practice.  So, it sounds like a moment where Relearn is right on time. </div> <div class="right"> <h3>Ludivine by Caroline</h3> She studied typography at École Estienne, in Paris for four years. Just after graduating she moved to Brussels, at first for an internship at Speculoos. She then worked with there for four years and eventually joined the OSP project. She is now totally devoted to OSP and her lessons at Erg, where she teaches typography (BAC 1-2-3). She is 30 years old and she did a parachute jump for this occasion and “allez c’est chouette”. </div> </div> <div class="container-couple"> <div class="left"> <h3>PierreH by Eleanor</h3> is a graphic designer and teacher of Book Doing and Print Making (before the binding) at La Cambre; is from Brussels; works in OSP; has his own design agency Speculoos; connects analog and digital tools; has very nice pieces of Franglais that you can taste immediately. </div> <div class="right"> <h3>Eleanor by PierreH</h3> I knew a bit the part concerning her Piet Zwart post master, in Networked Media. She is interested in how groups are working and dialoguing. Some of the previous workshops she proposed were about consensus and dissensus. She made an experimental collaborative drawing session using a Ouija board (spiritism).     </span><br><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/rexfeatures_582062k.jpg"><span class="authora_haku8ntVRgd6QbCa">http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/rexfeatures_582062k.jpg</span></a><span class="authora_haku8ntVRgd6QbCa">   U R NEVER ALONE She’s now doing a residency in Constant Variable for 3 weeks. </div> </div> <div class="container-couple"> <div class="left"> <h3>Antoine by Kévin</h3> Student at ÉSAD Valence, intern at OSP since the beginning of the month.
