And the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all his fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for to know your history, she do.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone. “Sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself “I don’t see how he can <em>ever</em> finish, if he doesn’t begin." But she waited patiently.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “I was a real Turtle.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, “Thank you, Sir, for your interesting story," but she could not help thinking there <em>must</em> be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call him Tortoise—”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Alice asked.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtle angrily. “Really you are very dull!”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about it!” and he went on in these words:</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it—”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on:</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school every day—”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“<em>I’ve</em> been to a day-school, too,” said Alice. “You needn’t be so proud as all that.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle, a little anxiously.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Yes,” said Alice; “we learned French and music.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Ah! Then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. “Now, at <em>ours</em>, they had, at the end of the bill, ’French, music, <em>and washing</em>—extra.’”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “living at the bottom of the sea.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“I couldn’t afford to learn it,” said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. “I only took the regular course.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“What was that?” inquired Alice.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtle replied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“I never heard of ’Uglification,’” Alice ventured to say. “What is it?”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “Never heard of uglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify is, you <em>are</em> a simpleton.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it: so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said, “What else had you to learn?”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers—"Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week: <em>he</em> taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“What was <em>that</em> like?” said Alice.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Well, I can’t show it you, myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learned it.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to the Classical master, though. He was an old crab, <em>he</em> was.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh. “He taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine the next, and so on.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphon remarked: “because they lessen from day to day.”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?”</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.</span><br><span class="authora_P6M8x6u92oqUkTNq">“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone. “Tell her something about the games now.”</span><br><br> <h2 style="font-size:
